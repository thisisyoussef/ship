# Ship - Single Source of Truth

**Last Updated**: 2026-03-16
**Current Phase**: AI harness finalization-policy cleanup
**Active Sprint**: Merge-commit default for GitHub PR finalization
**Project Status**: Active
**Canonical Deployment Baseline**: API on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, frontend on S3/CloudFront, config/secrets on AWS-native services
**Sanctioned Public Demo**: Render `ship-demo` at `https://ship-demo.onrender.com/`, deployed with `scripts/deploy-render-demo.sh`

---

## Current Focus

### Active Task
- **Title**: Change the harness finalization default from squash merges to merge commits while keeping workflow wiring intact
- **Status**: Ready for audit
- **Owner**: Codex

### Next Immediate Actions
1. Keep `AGENTS.md`, `.ai/codex.md`, and `.ai/workflows/git-finalization.md` aligned around merge-commit default finalization.
2. Update `scripts/check_ai_wiring.sh` so merge-commit default behavior is enforced by the AI wiring audit.
3. Sync the durable memory/docs surfaces so future agents do not drift back to squash-default finalization.

## Repo Baseline

- **Canonical repo handbook**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- **Canonical orchestrator**: `.ai/codex.md`
- **Compatibility mirrors**: `.ai/agents/claude.md`, `.ai/agents/cursor-agent.md`
- **Root agent entrypoints**: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- **Live AI workspace**: `.ai/`
- **Story branch rule**: every new story starts on a fresh `codex/` branch after remote sync; do not continue a new story on the previous story's branch
- **Monorepo packages**:
  - `web/`: React + Vite frontend
  - `api/`: Express API + WebSocket collaboration server
  - `shared/`: shared TypeScript contracts
- **Primary data store**: PostgreSQL
- **Real-time layer**: TipTap + Yjs synced through the API collaboration server

## FleetGraph Assignment Constraints

- Use the Ship REST API as the data source. No direct database access.
- Working presearch assumption: FleetGraph is provider-agnostic with OpenAI as the preferred default, though Ship already has Bedrock Claude code that can be reused as fallback/reference.
- LangGraph is recommended. If another framework is used, manual LangSmith instrumentation is required.
- LangSmith tracing is required from day one.
- Public LangSmith share links must be explicit opt-in because anyone with the link can view the trace.
- Implement both proactive and on-demand modes through the same graph architecture.
- The chat interface must be embedded in Ship context. No standalone chatbot page.
- Consequential actions require a human-in-the-loop confirmation gate.
- Detection latency target: under 5 minutes from Ship event to surfaced finding.

## FleetGraph Architecture Snapshot

- Ship runtime is a unified document graph exposed through REST, not a resource-silo app.
- Live relationship data is mixed between canonical `document_associations` and legacy properties such as `project_id` and `assignee_ids`.
- The current realtime layer is delivery-oriented WebSocket plumbing, not a durable trigger bus.
- The recommended MVP shape is same-origin FleetGraph API routes for chat plus a separate background worker for proactive runs.

## Story Execution Guardrails

- Follow `AGENTS.md`, `.ai/codex.md`, and the active workflow for validation commands, branch rollover, deployment review, and handoff requirements.
- Keep the sanctioned public demo reference current: `scripts/deploy-render-demo.sh` -> `https://ship-demo.onrender.com/`.
- For deploy-relevant stories, deployment status must still be explicit: `deployed`, `not deployed`, or `blocked`.
