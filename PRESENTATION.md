## Technical Highlights

### Document Model Extension

Two new document types added to unified model:
- `standup` - Daily updates (week association via document_associations, author_id)
- `sprint_review` - Week reviews (historical name; week association via document_associations, owner_id)

### Authorization Patterns

| Endpoint | Who Can Access |
|----------|---------------|
| Standup PATCH/DELETE | Author only (403 for others) |
| Sprint Review PATCH | Owner only (403 for others) |
| Project Retro PATCH | Any workspace member |

### Pre-fill Pattern

All GET endpoints return intelligent drafts:
```json
{
  "is_draft": true,
  "content": { /* pre-filled TipTap JSON */ },
  "issues_summary": { "completed": 5, "active": 2 }
}
```

After POST/PATCH, `is_draft` becomes `false`.

## Test Coverage

- **174 unit tests** passing
- **New test files:**
  - `api/src/routes/standups.test.ts`
  - `api/src/routes/sprint-reviews.test.ts`
  - `api/src/routes/project-retros.test.ts`

---

## UI Error Handling

All components include comprehensive error handling with toast notifications:

- **Network errors** - "Failed to load/save. Please try again."
- **Authorization errors (403)** - "You can only edit your own standups/reviews"
- **Conflict errors (409)** - "A review already exists. Refreshing..."
- **Success confirmations** - "Standup posted", "Review saved", etc.

---

## Philosophy Documentation

New docs added:
- `docs/sprint-documentation-philosophy.md` - The "why" behind this feature set

**Core principle:** Every sprint answers a hypothesis. The tooling makes capturing those learnings frictionless.
