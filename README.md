## What is Ship?

Ship is a project management tool that combines documentation, issue tracking, and plan-driven weekly workflows in one place. Instead of switching between a wiki, a task tracker, and a spreadsheet, everything lives together.

**Built by the U.S. Department of the Treasury** for government teams, but useful for any organization that wants to work more effectively.

---

## How to Use Ship

Ship has four main views, each designed for different questions:

| View | What it answers |
|------|-----------------|
| **Docs** | "Where's that document?" — Wiki-style pages for team knowledge |
| **Issues** | "What needs to be done?" — Track tasks, bugs, and features |
| **Projects** | "What are we building?" — Group issues into deliverables |
| **Teams** | "Who's doing what?" — See workload across people and weeks |

### The Basics

1. **Create documents** for anything your team needs to remember — meeting notes, specs, onboarding guides
2. **Create issues** for work that needs to get done — assign them to people and track progress
3. **Group issues into projects** to organize related work
4. **Write weekly plans** to declare what you intend to accomplish each week

Everyone on the team can edit documents at the same time. You'll see other people's cursors as they type.

---

## The Ship Philosophy

### Everything is a Document

In Ship, there's no difference between a "wiki page" and an "issue" at the data level. They're all documents with different properties. This means:

- You can link any document to any other document
- Issues can have rich content, not just a title and description
- Projects and weeks are documents too — they can contain notes, decisions, and context

### Plans Are the Unit of Intent

Ship is plan-driven: each week starts with a written plan declaring what you intend to accomplish and ends with a retro capturing what you learned. Issues are a trailing indicator of what was done, not a leading indicator of what to do.

1. **Plan (Weekly Plan)** — Before the week, write down what you intend to accomplish and why
2. **Execute (The Week)** — Do the work; issues track what was actually done
3. **Reflect (Weekly Retro)** — After the week, write down what actually happened and what you learned

This isn't paperwork for paperwork's sake. Teams that skip retrospectives repeat the same mistakes. Teams that write things down learn and improve.

### Learning, Not Compliance

Documentation requirements in Ship are visible but not blocking. You can start a new week without finishing the last retro. But the system makes missing documentation obvious — it shows up as a visual indicator that escalates from yellow to red over time.

The goal isn't to check boxes. It's to capture what your team learned so you can get better.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or newer
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for the database)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/US-Department-of-the-Treasury/ship.git
cd ship

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Configure environment
cp api/.env.example api/.env.local
cp web/.env.example web/.env

# 4. Start the database
docker-compose up -d

# 5. Create sample data
pnpm db:seed

# 6. Run database migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# 7. Start the application
pnpm dev
```

### Open the App

Once it's running, open your browser to:

**http://localhost:5173**

Log in with the demo account:
- **Email:** `dev@ship.local`
- **Password:** `admin123`

### What's Running

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Web app | http://localhost:5173 | The Ship interface |
| API server | http://localhost:3000 | Backend services |
| Swagger UI | http://localhost:3000/api/docs | Interactive API documentation |
| OpenAPI spec | http://localhost:3000/api/openapi.json | OpenAPI 3.0 specification |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5432 | Database (via Docker) |

### Common Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start everything
pnpm dev:web      # Start just the web app
pnpm dev:api      # Start just the API
pnpm db:seed      # Reset database with sample data
pnpm db:migrate   # Run database migrations
pnpm test         # Run tests
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture

Ship is a monorepo with three packages:

- **web/** — React frontend with TipTap editor for real-time collaboration
- **api/** — Express backend with WebSocket support
- **shared/** — TypeScript types used by both

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React, Vite, TailwindCSS |
| Editor | TipTap + Yjs (real-time collaboration) |
| Backend | Express, Node.js |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Real-time | WebSocket |

### Design Decisions

- **Everything is a document** — Single `documents` table with a `document_type` field
- **Server is truth** — Offline-tolerant, syncs when reconnected
- **Boring technology** — Well-understood tools over cutting-edge experiments
- **E2E testing** — 73+ Playwright tests covering real user flows

See [docs/application-architecture.md](docs/application-architecture.md) for more.

---

## Testing

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
pnpm test

# Run tests with UI
pnpm test:ui

# Run specific test file
pnpm test e2e/documents.spec.ts
```

Ship uses Playwright for end-to-end testing with 73+ tests covering all major functionality.

## Grader Workflow

The reproducible audit harness now runs reliably in GitHub Actions.

- Workflow page: [Audit Runner](https://github.com/thisisyoussef/ship/actions/workflows/audit-runner.yml)
- Actions runs: [All workflow runs](https://github.com/thisisyoussef/ship/actions/workflows/audit-runner.yml?query=event%3Aworkflow_dispatch)
- Submission branch measured by the workflow: [`codex/submission-clean`](https://github.com/thisisyoussef/ship/tree/codex/submission-clean)
- Baseline repo used by default: [US-Department-of-the-Treasury/ship](https://github.com/US-Department-of-the-Treasury/ship)

What the workflow does:

- checks out the fork workflow entrypoint on `master`
- immediately checks out `codex/submission-clean` for the actual audit harness code
- clones Treasury `master` and the submission branch
- runs the same reproducible harness used by `pnpm audit:grade`
- uploads raw artifacts and posts the same results back into the hosted dashboard

What the grader can use directly:

- open the workflow page and inspect run logs, job steps, and uploaded artifacts
- use the hosted dashboard for the latest stored comparison output
- run the harness locally with `pnpm audit:grade`

Important note:

- viewing Actions runs and artifacts works without changing the repo
- manually clicking `Run workflow` requires repository permission on GitHub
- if direct workflow execution is not available to the grader, the local one-shot command remains:

```bash
pnpm audit:grade
```

See [docs/g4/improvement-verification-guide.md](./docs/g4/improvement-verification-guide.md) for the exact command contract and reproduction paths.
